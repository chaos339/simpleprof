  Hi! I’m <b>@chaos339.</b> Or you can call me <b>Malks</b>. It's like my first name in real life 
  but I think this sounds cooler. This is also my username on my other accounts so yeah.</p>
<p>
  I’m currently learning Lua during my semester break. Yes, I'm still studying, I'm currently a second year IT student somewhere in Asia. I'm trying to get a hold of Lua language during my spare time since I heard that the institute/college that I am going to is not planning on teaching it.
  So yeah, the only way to learn something that will not be taught is to `self-study` it.
</p>
<p>
  I have a bit of experience in C++, Javascript, C# (Very Little), HTML, CSS. Most of the programming languages I've stated is the ones that was taught in my college. Although, if I am going to be honest, I had to self-study most of it.
